INSTALLAITON
User can install ODP package in any directory of her/his choosing and configure
this directory in 'app_detector_dir' option in:
  - appid table in snort 3 lua configuration
  - appId preprocessor configuration in snort 2.9.x
Directory location "/usr/local/cisco/apps" is recommended. Before installation,
it is recommended to delete "odp" subdirectory 

When installed, ODP will create following sub-directories:
    odp/lua     //Cisco Lua detectors
    odp/libs    //Cisco Lua modules

Installing ODP will not modify any subdirectory named custom, where
user-created detectors are located.

Example: 
    cd /usr/local/cisco/apps
    rm -rf odp
    tar -xzvf <ODP package>
